# Altera Device Experiments

This repository is built for:

- Embedded systems prototyping
- Digital design education
- Legacy FPGA/CPLD workflows
- Open-source hardware exploration

Each project emphasizes:

- ✅ Reusable logic blocks (GPIO, UART, timers, etc.)
- 🧰 Board-specific configurations
- 🧪 Simulation-ready setups with ModelSim
- 📚 Structured documentation for clarity and reuse

## 📦 Supported Devices

- Cyclone II (EP2C5, EP2C8)
- MAX II (EPM240, EPM570)
- Arria GX / Arria 10
- Other Altera-compatible boards

## 📁 Repository Structure

/cyclone2-labs → HDL projects for Cyclone II boards 
/max2-demos → CPLD workflows for MAX II devices 
/arria-experiments → Advanced FPGA setups for Arria family 
/shared-modules → Reusable HDL components
